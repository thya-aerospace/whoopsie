In case you want to test whoopsie quickly, please refere to [Getting Started](/whoopsie/getting-started/)

In case you want to know more about the whoopsie protocol, please refere to [Whoopsie Protocol](/whoopsie/whoopsie-protocol/)

## Overview
*overall concept*
 - client server architecture
 - general setup
 - use cases and external context
 - 3rd party dependencies
 - security

The here elaborated Whoopsie Client-Server architecture is an implementation of the Whoopsie Protocol. The goal of the implementation is to transport the simplicity of the protocol into the implemenation. In case, users have very specific requirements which are currently out of scope for the implmentation, this documentation shall help them to extend the architecture. Please take a look at [Potetnial Extensions/Adaptions](/whoopsie/documentation#Potetntial_Extensions/Adaptions)  


## Whoopsie Client
*consider Cpp and python options here, enable arduino*
- client integration examples
- client components
- configuration options

## Whoopsie Server
- server integration examples
- server components
- server interfaces
- configuration options

## Potential Extensions/Adaptions
TBD
